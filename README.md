# Phys-GNNs
Experimenting with Graph Neural Networks for physics-based simulations.
This repository collects various work-in-progress GNN projects aiming to achieve the precision of computationally-expensive simulators.

### Exercises
- [Jacobi Heat Simulator](/00-heat-simulator): a simple GCN learning 2D heat propagation.
